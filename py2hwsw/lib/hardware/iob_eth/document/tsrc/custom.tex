                The minimum Ethernet packet is 64 bytes long. If a reception of
                smaller frames is needed, assert the RECSMALL bit (in the mode
                register MODER) or change the value of this register. To

                The maximum Ethernet packet is 1518 bytes long. To support this
                and to leave some additional space for the tags, a default
                maximum packet length equals 1536 bytes (0x0600). If there is a
                need to support bigger packets, you can assert the HUGEN bit or
                increase the value of the MAXFL field (see the HUGEN bit

                This field specifies the maximum number of consequential
                retransmission attempts after the collision is detected. When
                the maximum number has been reached, the Tx MAC reports an
                error and stops transmitting the current packet. According to
                the Ethernet standard, the MAXRET default value is set to 0xf

                Collisions" and transmission of the current packet is aborted.
                The default value equals 0x3f (by default, a late collision is

\section{Buffer Descriptors}
\label{sec:buffer_descriptors}
The buffer descriptors are 64 bits long. The first 32 bits are reserved for
length and status while the last 32 bits contain the pointer to the associated
buffer (where data is stored). The Ethernet MAC core has an internal RAM that
can store up to 128 BDs (for both Rx and Tx). 

The internal memory saves all descriptors at addresses from 0x400 to 0x7ff (128
64bit descriptors). The transmit descriptors are located between the start
address (0x400) and the address that equals the value written in the
TX\_BD\_NUM register (page 14) multiplied by 8. This register holds the number
of the used Tx buffer descriptors. The receive descriptors are located between
the start address (0x400), plus the address number written in the TX\_BD\_NUM
multiplied by 8, and the descriptor end address (0x7ff). The transmit and
receive status of the packet is written to the associated buffer descriptor
once its transmission/reception is finished.
