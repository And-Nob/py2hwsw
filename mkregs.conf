//START_SWREG_TABLE axistream_in 
IOB_SWREG_R(AXISTREAMIN_OUT, 4, 0, 0, 1) //32 bits: Get next FIFO output (Reading from this register makes it pop the next value from FIFO)
IOB_SWREG_R(AXISTREAMIN_EMPTY, 1, 0, 8, 0) //1 bit: Return if FIFO is empty (May be empty due to waiting for more data or because it received a TLAST signal)
IOB_SWREG_R(AXISTREAMIN_LAST, 2, 0, 12, 0) //1+4 bits: [Bit 4] Signals if FIFO is empty due to receiving a TLAST signal; [Bit 3-0] Tells which bytes (from latest value of AXISTREAMIN_OUT) are valid (similar to WSTRB signal of AXI Stream). (Reading from this register makes it reset and starts filling FIFO with next frame)
